# LAK18 Hackathon
For [Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference](https://latte-analytics.sydney.edu.au/) Hackathon 2018.  
There is also a [Hackathon website](https://lakhackathon.wordpress.com/).

The repository for the [2017 LAK Hackathon](https://github.com/LAK-Hackathon/LAK17Hackathon) may be of interest.

**NB: there is a [separate general-purpose Learning Analytics Hackathon Support Material repository](https://github.com/LAK-Hackathon/Support-Materials)**, which contains materials not specific to a given hackathon event. (This is a fork of a repository created by Michael Webb from Jisc)

## Purpose of this Repository
This is a free-for-all place to deposit anything created during the hackathon. The organisers will also use it to gather and disseminate information prior to the hackathon. If you are not a git user, find someone who is to help or show you how to add files.

If you are a git user wishing to contribute, please either: a) create a branch, or b) fork. The master branch is protected; issue a pull request, supplying a helpful message.

## Using Issues and Projects
We will be using the "Issues" tracker to gather ideas for challenges to work on during the hackathon. Use the label "challenge".

Once working groups have formed, please use the "Projects" feature to brainstorm ideas about dealing with the challenge, and to organise priorities for action during the Hackathon. You will need a GitHub login which has been added to the Participants team (talk to the organisers).

## Structure of the Repository
* slides/ - copies of slide decks used in the introductory part of the Hackathon.
* technical_docs/ - documentation etc for the technical infrastructure.
* groups/ - a place where each working group can deposit outputs of any kind, from photographs of flipcharts to working code.
