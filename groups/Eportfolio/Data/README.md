# Introduction
Alan Berg - March 2018

The sample.rdata and sample.csv.zip contain 20,000 raw UK job advertisments in R and CSV format.
To load into R simply **load("sample.rdata")** you will now have a sample object ready for manipulation.

Our motivation for the donation of this example dataset is to support development of a benchmark for authentic task extraction within the context of the UK Job market. Later, we can compare to similar datasets from other languages.
